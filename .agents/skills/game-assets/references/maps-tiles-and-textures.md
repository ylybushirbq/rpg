## Important guidance

### Start isometric and hex tile generation from built-in references

- Before generating any isometric or hex map tile, browse the map-reference catalog, download the selected references, and start generation from those downloaded files. These generators have strict tile-size and anchor contracts; an arbitrary image can produce a tile whose gameplay footprint does not match the required grid.
- Do not substitute a casually selected web image or unrelated local image for a supported map reference. Choose the nearest structural reference first, then use the prompt to describe the desired material, theme, decoration, and art style.
- The built-in catalog contains more than one thousand references across multiple styles. To explore styles, select different references and describe the intended style in natural language; the generation model can interpret that combination without a rigid style keyword.

### Assemble pixel-isometric tiles by their logical centers

- Treat every generated tile image as dimension- and anchor-correct. Do not crop, resize, stretch, or otherwise change it after generation. The image center is the logical tile center.
- In standard pixel-isometric mode, use a base diamond of 128×64. Direct neighbors on the two grid axes have center offsets `(64, 32)` and `(-64, 32)`. Centers aligned on the same horizontal line are 128 pixels apart; centers aligned on the same vertical line are 64 pixels apart.
- Decorations may extend far above the base, so the outer PNG height can be much larger without changing the center lattice.
- A pixel-isometric `tetraploid` tile covers approximately four base tiles. Reserve twice the base width and twice the base vertical footprint when assembling it: a logical 256×128 area.

### Assemble pixel hex-isometric tiles by center offsets

- Keep every generated image unchanged and align it by its logical center.
- With a 64-pixel hex side, use an exact 127-pixel same-row center stride. This is `2 × 64 - 1`, so adjacent hexes share one edge-pixel column instead of leaving a seam.
- Offset each following row by 64 pixels horizontally and 64 pixels vertically. The two downward diagonal offsets are `(64, 64)` and `(-63, 64)`; centers aligned vertically are 128 pixels apart across two rows.

## HD isometric and HD hex size contracts

These values mirror the production backend workflow constants and the production map-editor renderer. Do not derive placement from the outer PNG dimensions: final images are center-anchored and may contain different amounts of transparent padding.

### HD Isometric

- `hd_isometric_gen` uses a base block side length of `372` and a block height of `119`. Its standard top face is logically `744×372` and occupies one map cell.
- In unscaled workflow coordinates, the two isometric axes move the center by `(372, 186)` and `(-372, 186)`.
- The product map editor normalizes that source geometry to the same `128×64` logical cell used by the isometric grid. The displayed center offsets are therefore `(64, 32)` and `(-64, 32)`. The preview scales the HD source smoothly; do not use nearest-neighbor sampling for HD art.
- `tetraploid` doubles the block side to `744`, has a `1488×744` logical top face, and occupies a `2×2` footprint. Reserve all four cells. Its render anchor is the center of that four-cell footprint, not the outer PNG corner.
- The draw scale for a centered single HD asset is `128 / min(image_width, 744)`. For a `2×2` asset, use `128 / min(image_width / 2, 744)`. Scale width and height by the same factor and place the scaled image center on the logical footprint center.

### HD Hex Isometric

- `hd_hex_isometric_gen` uses a hex side length of `300` and a bottom-layer height of `96`.
- In unscaled workflow coordinates, same-row centers are `599` pixels apart (`2×300−1`). The next row moves down by `354` pixels (`1.5×300−96`) and shifts right by `300` pixels. The downward offsets are `(300, 354)` and `(-299, 354)`.
- The product map editor uses a `0.25×` smooth display scale. The resulting side length is `75`, same-row stride is `149.75`, row stride is `88.5`, and odd-row offset is `75`. The displayed downward offsets are `(75, 88.5)` and `(-74.75, 88.5)`.
- Standard HD hex tiles occupy `1×1`. `tetraploid` occupies `2×2`. For an even anchor row, the occupied cell offsets are `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(-1,1)`, and `(0,1)`; for an odd anchor row they are `(0,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(1,1)`.
- The backend contains an internal seven-hex layout and an Image2 path, but both are temporarily closed. The public `hd-hex-isometric-gen-run` Skill surface exposes only `standard` and `tetraploid` with Nano Banana.

### Shared HD rules

- Keep the generated PNG unchanged. Do not crop, recenter, or resize the source file; transparent padding preserves the center anchor.
- Use smooth sampling for HD Isometric and HD Hex. Nearest-neighbor and integer-only enlargement remain requirements for pixel modes, not HD modes.
- A larger outer image does not imply a larger footprint. Footprint comes from the generation mode: `standard = 1×1`, `tetraploid = 2×2`.
- When standard and tetraploid Isometric assets overlap, depth-sort with every occupied footprint cell and the rendered image bounds. Do not sort only by the anchor cell or by `column + row`; a `2×2` asset can cross the depth of neighboring `1×1` assets.

### Review the assembled map, not isolated canvas bounds

- Tile PNG dimensions may differ because decorations need different amounts of transparent padding, but their centers remain aligned to the logical tile centers. Transparent space around a tile does not change its placement.
- Assemble a small test area, capture a screenshot, inspect seams and perceived alignment, then adjust placement and iterate. Change the map coordinates or assembly logic when needed; do not crop or scale the generated tile files.

## Preview and assembly tool

- Use [map-tile-layout.js](../scripts/map-tile-layout.js) as the compact frontend coordinate reference. It exposes the verified pixel and HD center functions, neighbor offsets, HD display scales, and center-based image placement.
- Use [map-preview-server.py](../scripts/map-preview-server.py) as the matching backend. It validates local media, mode names, and `1×1`/`2×2` footprint declarations, then returns only opaque `media/<id>` URLs and public preview fields.
- Use [map-tile-layout-demo.html](../assets/map-tile-layout-demo.html) as the single frontend for every map review mode. Its top selector switches between Side View, Pixel Isometric, Pixel Hex Isometric, HD Isometric, HD Hex Isometric, Top-down Dual-grid, and Isometric Dual-grid without changing the page or backend. Projected modes let the user select, paint, erase, clear, or fill tiles. Side View repeats three layers, previews smooth parallax, lets the user drag layer offsets, and includes the bundled four-frame cat for movement and depth review.
- Use the same previewer at two stages: preview references explicitly downloaded through `map-reference-download` before generation to compare their layout and visual direction; preview declared final tiles after generation to check anchors, seams, transitions, and composition. A downloaded reference remains an input and must not be presented as a generated deliverable.
- The previewer runs entirely in the local browser and loads no external resources. It never rewrites source files. Pixel modes use nearest-neighbor rendering and only 1×–4× integer display zoom. HD Isometric and HD Hex keep the same logical grid but allocate the Canvas backing buffer at `preview zoom × devicePixelRatio`, then render with high-quality smooth sampling; do not enlarge a low-resolution HD Canvas through CSS alone. Side-scrolling layer cards intentionally use nearest-neighbor downsampling to fit the complete layer into their overview boxes. Dual-grid atlas lookup and pointer behavior are reduced from the repository's `scripts/tilesets/dual-grid.html` reference implementation.

### Build the preview for the user

Start the preview yourself from either the downloaded public reference paths or the final tile paths. Do not ask the user to open the generic page and locate files in a deep output directory:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/scripts/map-preview-server.py \
  --mode isometric \
  --image <reference-or-final-tile-1.png> \
  --image <reference-or-final-tile-2.png> \
  --columns 8 \
  --rows 6 \
  --lifetime 900
```

- Use `isometric` or `hex` with one or more independent reference or final tile images. The generated page initially cycles them across the map and still lets the user select, paint, and erase tiles.
- Use `hd-isometric` or `hd-hex-isometric` for HD assets. A direct `--image` is treated as a standard `1×1` tile. Use a JSON `libraries` entry with `"footprint": "2x2"` for tetraploid assets.
- Use `dual-grid` or `iso-dual-grid` with exactly one final 4×4 atlas. The page starts with a filled map and computes the 15 transition variants while the user paints or erases terrain.
- Use `side-scrolling` with `--side-scrolling-dir <final-output-dir>` when the directory contains `background.png`, `midground.png`, and `foreground.png`. Alternatively pass a user-owned `--manifest <manifest.json>` or the three explicit `--background`, `--midground`, and `--foreground` paths. An optional `--player-sprite` accepts a horizontal four-frame PNG/WebP sprite sheet.
- The Python backend returns only logical preview settings and allowlisted `media/<id>` URLs. It never sends source filesystem paths to the frontend, never exposes a directory, and loads no external network resource.
- The single frontend keeps its manual file picker as a fallback. When served by this backend it loads every configured mode library and the Side View layers automatically; switching modes does not start another server or open another page.
- Load only user-provided local files, map references explicitly obtained through the public `map-reference-download` command, or declared final workflow outputs. Keep the preview on loopback. Never load private workflow templates, masks, raw provider results, metadata, or other internal intermediate artifacts into it.

For repeatable setups, store paths relative to the JSON file or use absolute paths locally:

```json
{
  "mode": "isometric",
  "images": ["tiles/grass.png", "tiles/stone.png"],
  "columns": 8,
  "rows": 6,
  "zoom": 2,
  "grid": true
}
```

Run `map-preview-server.py --config <preview.json>`; explicit CLI values override matching config values. Read the printed JSON URL and open it in the user's browser when browser control is available. The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, serves the preview directly at the clean `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` root URL, disables caching, and shuts down automatically. Complete this step yourself; do not ask the user to copy the URL or operate a file picker.

To review several map systems in one page, replace `images` with mode-specific `libraries`. Add `side_scrolling` to the same configuration when a Side View layer set is also available. The mode selector then activates each loaded system without another upload, page, or backend:

```json
{
  "mode": "side-scrolling",
  "side_scrolling": {
    "directory": "layers"
  },
  "libraries": {
    "dual-grid": ["tiles/dual-grid.png"],
    "isometric": ["tiles/iso-grass.png", "tiles/iso-water.png"],
    "hex": ["tiles/hex-desert.png", "tiles/hex-ocean.png"],
    "hd-isometric": [
      {"path": "tiles/hd-city.png", "footprint": "1x1"},
      {"path": "tiles/hd-city-block.png", "footprint": "2x2"}
    ],
    "hd-hex-isometric": [
      {"path": "tiles/hd-hex-city.png", "footprint": "1x1"}
    ]
  },
  "columns": 8,
  "rows": 6,
  "zoom": 2,
  "grid": true
}
```

The Side View directory must contain `background.png`, `midground.png`, and `foreground.png` (WebP is also accepted). Each dual-grid library must contain exactly one 4×4 atlas. Isometric and hex libraries may contain multiple independent final tiles. Library entries may be path strings for `1×1`, or objects with `path` and `footprint`; use `2x2` only for a generated tetraploid result. Do not combine `--image` with `libraries`.

Use [build-map-preview.py](../scripts/build-map-preview.py) only when a portable standalone HTML file is explicitly useful. The automatic review path should prefer the lightweight backend so large images are not base64-duplicated into HTML.

Preview a generated side-scrolling layer set without locating each file manually:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/scripts/map-preview-server.py \
  --mode side-scrolling \
  --side-scrolling-dir <directory-containing-three-final-layers> \
  --zoom 1 \
  --lifetime 900
```

The server resolves only the three exact final layer filenames and sends the browser opaque local media URLs. A prefab manifest is read only for those image paths and initial Y offsets; prompts, refined prompts, workflow metadata, and unrelated files are not serialized to the page. The preview is read-only with respect to source files: changing offsets affects only the current browser session and exported review frame.

Center a generated image without changing its dimensions:

```javascript
const center = layout.isometricCenter(column, row, {
  originX,
  originY,
  tileSize: 64,
});
const topLeft = layout.centerImageAt(image.width, image.height, center);
ctx.drawImage(image, topLeft.x, topLeft.y);
```

Mirror the HD frontend renderer without changing the source file:

```javascript
const footprintSpan = Math.max(footprintWidth, footprintHeight);
const isoScale = layout.hdIsometricAssetScale(image.width, footprintSpan);
const isoCenter = layout.isometricCenter(column, row, { tileSize: 64 });
ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = true;
ctx.drawImage(
  image,
  isoCenter.x - image.width * isoScale / 2,
  isoCenter.y - image.height * isoScale / 2,
  image.width * isoScale,
  image.height * isoScale,
);

const hexCenter = layout.hdHexCenter(column, row);
const hexScale = layout.HD_HEX_DISPLAY_SCALE;
ctx.drawImage(
  image,
  hexCenter.x - image.width * hexScale / 2,
  hexCenter.y - image.height * hexScale / 2,
  image.width * hexScale,
  image.height * hexScale,
);
```

The backend configuration is deliberately path-based and footprint-explicit:

```json
{
  "mode": "hd-isometric",
  "libraries": {
    "hd-isometric": [
      {"path": "final_tiles/standard.png", "footprint": "1x1"},
      {"path": "final_tiles/tetraploid.png", "footprint": "2x2"}
    ]
  }
}
```

The backend validates the footprint and converts the local path to an opaque `media/<id>` URL. It never sends the source path to the browser.

## Validated small pixel-isometric path

- Use `isometric-gen-run --mode standard` for the tested small pixel-isometric path. It requires exactly two downloaded reference images and produces two independent final tiles plus a pack preview. Assemble the final files with the 128×64 logical footprint defined above.
- Inspect `map-reference-search --categories --type pixel-isometric`, then select an exact theme and layout such as `--theme grassland --layout single`. Use free-text `--query` only as an optional refinement.
- Download two selected preset ids with `map-reference-download` and pass both downloaded PNG files through repeated `--reference-image` options.
- Expect transparent padding around each final RGBA tile. Validate the visible subject bounds and logical geometry rather than assuming the outer PNG canvas is exactly 64×64.
- Compare visible bounds and anchor placement across every tile. Different transparent outer-canvas sizes are acceptable when the logical geometry and placement anchor remain correct.
- Treat `tile_pack_preview.png` as a review layout. Use the independent tile files in the game and do not pixelate them again.

## Purpose

Use this module to create environment materials and map-ready assets: seamless textures, terrain atlases, isometric or hex tiles, and layered side-scrolling scenes.

| Capability | Command | Final role | Main limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discover reusable map references | `map-reference-search`, `map-reference-download` | Supply planning or supported reference inputs | Not every map command accepts downloaded references |
| Discover standard flat textures | `texture-reference-search`, `texture-reference-download` | Supply exact 64×64 material inputs for top-down dual-grid generation | The Skill currently exposes only 64px textures |
| Generate flat or isometric textures | `texture-gen-run`, `isometric-texture-run` | Produce repeatable material tiles | Validate seams before tileset use |
| Generate flat or isometric tilesets | `tileset-gen-run`, `isometric-tileset-run` | Produce terrain transition atlases | Single- and dual-terrain modes have different contracts |
| Generate isometric or hex map tiles | `isometric-gen-run`, `hex-isometric-gen-run`, HD variants | Produce map-ready projected tile sets | Mode names and supported references vary by command |
| Generate side-scrolling layers | `side-scrolling-map-run`, `hd-side-scrolling-map-run` | Produce aligned foreground, midground, and background layers | Uses text descriptions rather than downloaded map presets |

Use a texture as a tileset reference only when the tileset command accepts it. Treat side-scrolling generation as a separate layered-scene path, not the final stage of the texture or tileset pipeline.

## Search reusable map references when supported

Start with the catalog instead of guessing search words:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py map-reference-search \
  --categories

python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py map-reference-search \
  --categories \
  --type hd-isometric
```

Supported types are `pixel-isometric`, `pixel-hex-isometric`, `hd-isometric`, `hd-hex-isometric`, and `tileset`. The catalog response lists the valid themes and layouts for each type. Query one exact branch with structured filters:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py map-reference-search \
  --type pixel-isometric \
  --theme grassland \
  --layout single \
  --limit 12

python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py map-reference-search \
  --type hd-isometric \
  --theme modern \
  --layout single \
  --limit 12
```

Layouts are type-specific: square isometric types use `single` or `2x2`; pixel hex also supports `7-cell` and `template`; tilesets use `template`. `--layout` therefore requires `--type`. Use `--group` only for an advanced exact catalog-group filter.

Add `--query` after structured filters when a material or object refinement is useful. Search first requires all query words; if that produces no matches, it automatically falls back to results containing any query word and reports `match_mode: any-fallback`.

Download selected references into a task directory:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py map-reference-download \
  --preset-id <reference-id> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

The download command accepts the same `--type`, `--theme`, `--layout`, `--query`, and limit filters. Prefer explicit `--preset-id` values after reviewing search results so the chosen references remain deterministic.

Treat downloaded references as inputs, never as newly generated deliverables. Pass them only to a command that documents a reference or preset option. Side-scrolling commands do not accept these files; use search results only as planning inspiration for their text descriptions.

## Seamless textures

### What counts as a texture

A texture is a small, repeatable material sample that fills its entire square canvas edge to edge. For the public flat-texture and top-down dual-grid path in this Skill, it must be exactly `64×64` pixels.

A valid texture:

- shows one continuous material such as grass, dirt, stone, water, bricks, or floor boards;
- has no perspective and no visible camera angle;
- has no isolated object, character, building, landscape, horizon, frame, label, or text;
- has no transparent padding or large empty margin;
- can be repeated in both directions without changing scale.

A standalone HD illustration or a photo of one object is not a texture, even if its subject is a material. Do not upload a large image and rely on the tileset workflow to shrink it. Search or generate a real `64×64` texture instead.

Prefer a self-looping texture whose left and right edges match and whose top and bottom edges match. Top-down dual-grid generation has a strict tiling requirement: it reuses the texture across many cells, so a visible edge seam in the source becomes a repeated defect in the atlas and painted map. Do not use an arbitrary image merely because it is square.

Obtain suitable source textures in one of these ways:

- search and download a Meowa preset with `texture-reference-search` and `texture-reference-download`;
- generate a new texture with `texture-gen-run --self-loop`;
- download a tileable texture or game-art texture pack from a source such as itch.io.

For any external texture, confirm that the license permits the intended use, crop or select the actual material tile rather than a preview sheet, verify that it is exactly `64×64`, and preview it repeated in both axes before running the tileset workflow.

This Skill currently exposes only the 64px texture library and the 64px top-down dual-grid workflow. It does not expose the backend's 32px texture or dual-grid branches. A `32×32`, `128×128`, or other-sized image is rejected rather than silently resized.

### Search and download standard 64px references

List the public categories, then search and download one or more exact references:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py texture-reference-search \
  --categories

python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py texture-reference-search \
  --query "mossy grass" \
  --limit 12

python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py texture-reference-download \
  --reference-id <reference-id> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

`texture-reference-download` saves the selected official `64×64` files locally. These files are standard inputs for `tileset-gen-run`; they are references, not newly generated deliverables.

### Generate and download a new 64px texture

Use `texture-gen-run` when the standard library does not contain the required material:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py texture-gen-run \
  --prompt "Weathered blue-gray dungeon flagstones with sparse moss" \
  --self-loop \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

The command waits for the job and downloads the final `64×64` texture into the output directory. Inspect that final file before using it as a tileset input.

Isometric texture:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py isometric-texture-run \
  --prompt "Warm sandstone blocks with small cracks" \
  --reference-image <material-reference.png> \
  --self-loop \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use the isometric command when the final texture must already be projected as a 2:1 isometric tile. Keep `--self-loop` enabled for repeatable terrain unless the user explicitly wants a non-tiling sample.

## Terrain tilesets

### Top-down dual-grid tileset

The public Skill path is texture-first. Select one explicit terrain mode:

- `foreground`: generate only the central/filled terrain. Supply only `--foreground-texture`.
- `background`: generate only the surrounding terrain. Supply only `--background-texture`.
- `dual`: generate the transition between both terrains. Supply both texture options.

Every supplied texture must be exactly `64×64`.

Choose the terrain mode based on how the atlas will be reused:

- `foreground` is the usual choice. Generate the secondary terrain as a cutout atlas with `--remove-bg-method`, then paint it over any compatible base terrain. This is well suited to reusable patches such as grass, dirt, flowers, rock, snow, or shallow water.
- `dual` usually gives the best visual transition because the workflow sees both materials together, but the result is tied to that exact pair. For example, a grass-to-water atlas is not a reusable desert-to-water atlas. Use dual after the base terrain is fixed and the atlas only needs to serve that one material pairing.
- A practical environment workflow is to choose one base texture for the large scene first, such as grass or desert, then generate multiple foreground-only secondary textures that can be painted over that base.
- `background` is available for cases that specifically need the surrounding region as the reusable cutout, but it is less commonly needed than `foreground`.

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py tileset-gen-run \
  --terrain-mode dual \
  --foreground-texture <grass-64x64.png> \
  --background-texture <water-64x64.png> \
  --prompt "Background is water; foreground is grass." \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

For a foreground-only atlas:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py tileset-gen-run \
  --terrain-mode foreground \
  --foreground-texture <grass-64x64.png> \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

`--remove-bg-method {none,standard,advanced}` applies only to `foreground` and `background`. It removes the unused white region so the one-terrain atlas can be layered over a map. `dual` keeps both terrain regions and always disables background removal.

Keep the prompt minimal because the textures already provide the important visual information. A complex prompt can interfere with the workflow's terrain and transition decisions. Prefer one short relationship such as:

- `Background is dirt; foreground is grass.`
- `Grass in a pond.`
- `Lava in obsidian.`

If you are unsure what to write, omitting `--prompt` is generally fine because the texture inputs already provide the essential visual information. Do not write a long scene description, detailed composition instructions, repeated texture requirements, or elaborate transition prose for this workflow.

The prompt is optional and cannot replace the required texture inputs or change their dimensions. Foreground/background guide colors are inferred internally and are intentionally not exposed. The public `foreground` and `background` modes map to the backend's internal single-terrain workflow; users do not need to handle that internal term. The Skill also hides texture reference sizing and the 32px template.

The final result is a `256×256` 4×4 atlas containing 64px dual-grid tiles. Review it with the `dual-grid` preview mode before game integration.

### Isometric terrain tileset

The isometric command has a separate contract:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py isometric-tileset-run \
  --prompt "Volcanic basalt terrain with glowing red cracks" \
  --terrain-mode single \
  --single-terrain-region foreground \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

- Review a generated flat dual-grid atlas in `map-tile-layout-demo.html` with `Top-down Dual-grid 15`. Review an isometric dual-grid atlas with `Isometric Dual-grid 15`. Load the final 4×4 atlas, then paint, erase, or fill the preview map to verify transitions before game integration.

## Isometric and hex map tiles

Pixel isometric:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py isometric-gen-run \
  --prompt "A mossy stone dungeon floor tile with matching wall edges" \
  --mode standard \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --reference-image <floor-reference.png> \
  --reference-image <wall-reference.png> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Pixel hex-isometric:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py hex-isometric-gen-run \
  --prompt "A desert oasis hex tile with palms and a small blue pool" \
  --mode standard \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --reference-image <terrain-reference.png> \
  --reference-image <detail-reference.png> \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

Use `hd-isometric-gen-run` and `hd-hex-isometric-gen-run` for smooth HD map tiles. Reference counts are hard request contracts:

- Pixel isometric: `standard` requires 2 references; `edit` 1; `tetraploid` 1 large reference (visible width > 200 px) or 3 small references (visible width ≤ 200 px); `road` 2; `wall` 1.
- Pixel hex-isometric: `standard` requires 2 references; `edit` 1; `tetraploid` accepts 1 medium reference or 2–4 small references; `heptaploid` accepts 1 large reference (>360 px visible width) or 2–7 small references (≤256 px visible width), with no medium references or mixed sizes. The web picker accepts 2–4 small references. Pixel hex reference widths allow building overhang: small ≤256 px, medium 257–360 px, large >360 px; small generation accepts only small references.
- HD isometric `tetraploid` requires 2–4 references.
- HD hex-isometric `tetraploid` accepts 1–4 downloaded references. Do not rely on implicit template defaults in the public workflow.

The names `tetraploid` and `heptaploid` are compatibility mode names for multi-tile layouts, not art styles. Use them only when that layout is explicitly required.

## Side-scrolling maps

Use this workflow when the final deliverable is a parallax-ready horizontal scene rather than one flat background. It generates the playable midground, distant background, and near-camera foreground as aligned layers. Use `side-scrolling-map-run` for pixel art and `hd-side-scrolling-map-run` for HD art; downloaded map references are not required by these two commands.

Pixel map:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py side-scrolling-map-run \
  --midground "Dense enchanted forest paths and playable platforms" \
  --background "Layered blue mountains and a pale dawn sky" \
  --foreground "Dark leafy silhouettes and roots along the bottom edge" \
  --remove-bg-method standard \
  --loop-midground \
  --loop-background \
  --loop-foreground \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

HD map:

```bash
python3 skills/game-assets/meowart_api.py hd-side-scrolling-map-run \
  --midground "A readable coastal village path with shops and stairs" \
  --background "Ocean cliffs, distant islands, and soft clouds" \
  --foreground "Flowers, fence silhouettes, and rocks along the bottom" \
  --art-style 2d_hd \
  --loop-midground \
  --loop-background \
  --loop-foreground \
  --output-dir <output-dir>
```

The side-scrolling commands produce 1K-tier, 16:9 layer sets; inspect the saved files for their actual pixel dimensions. Every loop flag requests a horizontal end-to-start seam. Pixel side-scrolling requires foreground and midground background removal and therefore offers only `standard` and `advanced`; use `advanced` for difficult edges. Supported HD styles are `2d_hd`, `2d_cartoon`, `2d_ink`, `clay`, `low_poly_3d`, `steampunk`, and `anime_hd`. A non-empty `--custom-art-style` overrides the selected preset style; use it only when none of the presets matches.

After generation, start `map-preview-server.py --mode side-scrolling --side-scrolling-dir <saved-output-directory>`, or add the layer directory to the unified JSON configuration above when tile modes must be reviewed at the same time. Review the complete fitted layer thumbnails, select a layer and drag vertically on the main canvas, pause and resume the parallax, adjust relative speeds and Y offsets, drag or move the bundled cat, and inspect the repeated left/right seam. Keep the main canvas at 1× unless an integer enlargement is needed; only the navigation thumbnails may shrink.

## Validate

- Confirm the generated tile files have not been cropped, resized, stretched, or re-anchored.
- Assemble a small test map with the center intervals defined above and review a screenshot before scaling up the layout.
- Verify tile dimensions and grid alignment.
- Inspect seams by repeating textures in both axes.
- Confirm isometric tiles use the expected 2:1 projection and consistent anchor points.
- Confirm side-scrolling layers align at the same canvas size and loop without a visible seam when looping was requested.
- Preview pixel assets at integer zoom with nearest-neighbor sampling.
- Deliver only files listed in `final_outputs.json`.
